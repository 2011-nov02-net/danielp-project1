# this file defines pipleins, which are rules for building and validating source code in a repo.
# written in a format called YAML, similar to JSON or XML. 
# very sensitive to indentation

# trigger is  alist of branches that will trigger the pipeline to run.
trigger:
- main

# short for build-agent pool, so what kind of agent is going to be running the steps.
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# config vars used for multiple steps
variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

# two common types of steps, script, and "task"
# tasks from the right hand thingy are easier than writing our own scripts

#these steps are run in sequence by build agent, in a directory 
# that contians the most recent pushed repo
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '3.x'

- script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
    projects: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyStore.Store.Tests/MyStore.Store.Tests.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
    testRunTitle: 'Unit Tests'

  # can also include a working directory
